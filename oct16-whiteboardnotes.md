### observations re readings

- things that never end; the cult of ever-increasing improvement; intersection with gender and coding/education
- minimal computing: v. different philosophy of code!
- tech doesn't have to be non-humanistic; an older era in computing stressed people, while later article stressed financials, sell sell sell!
- old wine in new bottles, coders=labourers, 
- code permeates all, yet we are unaware; magic mirror reflecting ourselves to ourselves... unintended consequences: who has the responsibility to fix this mess? truth, truthiness, and fake news, consumers have to do the work <- the platform has offloaded its responsibilities...ethics!! accountability
- women in code, planned obsolescence, capitalism... power embedded in code. code creating a kind of reality (so capitalism SG: can there be marxist code?) truth.. who gets left out of the narrative?
